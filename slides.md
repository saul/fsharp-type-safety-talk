# Agenda

1. Introduction
1. Type safety in F#
1. Existential types
1. Generalised ADTs
1. Annulus of power

???

- don't sound like a zealot!
- the things f# gives us to help with type saftey
    - no nulls, options
    - single-case DUs / tiny-types
    - DU - can be done in OO but here is v easy (first class visitor pattern)
- the things we've built on this
    - GADTs - see Remco's noddy example - parser
    - existentials - from first principles
    - HLists
    - 'anulus of power'
        - input: unsafe - command args &c
        - inner: super-safe bit
        - need power to bridge this gap - existentials &c

# Introduction

Whirlwind tour of how F# enables stronger type safety compared to other languages.

Some of the concepts have been talked about more thoroughly already.

Others have only been touched upon and I'll expand on.

    Key takeaways will be starred and highlighted like this.

**Let's go!**

# `NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object`

???

So, what's the problem?

# Billion Dollar Mistake

Famous quote from the inventor of the _null_ reference himself:

> I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. [...] My goal was to ensure that **all use of references should be absolutely safe**, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement.

# Billion Dollar Mistake

`null` is a value used to represent the lack of a value. This is the problem.

--

1. subverts types .muted[(can be used for any reference type)]
1. is a special case .muted[(has to checked for everywhere)]
1. makes poor APIs .muted[(e.g. `String.IsNullOrEmpty`)]
1. difficult to debug .muted[(how did this become null?)]
1. plus many, many more

--

When your type system (e.g. Java, or C#) allows `null` everywhere, you cannot exclude the possibility of `null`.

It's inevitable it will wind up conflated somewhere.

name: nulls-in-fsharp

# Nulls in F#

Definition of a simple *record* type in F#:

```f#
type MyLittleType =
    {
        Foo : string
        Bar : int
    }
```

---

template: nulls-in-fsharp

The above is similar to this C# (and essentially compiles down to):

```c#
public class MyLittleType // Equatable, Comparable, etc.
{
    public MyLittleType(string foo, int bar)
    {
        this.Foo = foo;
        this.Bar = bar;
    }

    public readonly string Foo { get; }
    public readonly int Bar { get; }
}
```

---

template: nulls-in-fsharp

<hr>

```f#
let baz = { Foo = "Hello world"; Bar = 5 }
```

.success[OK!]

--

<hr>

```f#
let baz : MyLittleType = null
```

--

.error[
    `error FS0043: The type 'MyLittleType' does not have 'null' as a proper value`
]

# So how do you represent `null`?

---

# Why do we need `null`?

`null` in OO languages represents the lack of an instance.

**So why don't we encode that in the type system?**

---

# Discriminated union types

aka _union_ types.

```f#
type Option<'T> =
    | None
    | Some of value: 'T
```

`Option<'T>` is part of the F# core library and represents a missing value, or a value.

.important[
Seeing `null` anywhere in F# is a huge code smell. ðŸ’©
]

---

# Discriminated union types

aka _union_ types.

```f#
type Option<'T> =
    | None                  // parameterless case
    | Some of value: 'T     // case with a single generic parameter
```

---

# Using union types

```f#
let nothing = None  // This can satisfy any 'T in Option<'T>
val nothing : Option<'T>

let answer = Some 42
val answer : Option<int>
```
--
<hr>

Pulling values out of cases:

```f#
match answer with
| None ->
    printfn "There is no answer :("
| Some underlyingInt -> // Pattern is `Some underlyingInt`
    printfn "Answer to everything: %d" underlyingInt
    // ==> Answer to everything: 42
```

This is called _pattern matching_.

Can also pattern match on strings, integers, records, lists, arrays - very powerful.

---

# Exhaustive pattern matching

```f#
let checkForEmpty (foo : Option<int>) =
    match foo with
    | None -> printfn "Nothing here"
```

--

.error[
    `warning FS0025: Incomplete pattern matches on this expression. For example, the value 'Some (_)' may indicate a case not covered by the pattern(s).`
]

(Only a warning, but we all have Warnings As Errors ðŸ˜‰)

.important[
Every case must be handled.

TODO: None compiles down to null!

---

# Union types in C#

F# and C# compile down to IL which has the same type system.

![](option.png)

TODO: It's possible to model F# union types in C# as a _visitor pattern_.

---

# Sum types vs. union types

Examples of sum types in languages:

- Structs, classes

Examples of union types:

- Enums, unions in C/C++

TODO do we need this?

---

# Nullability in other languages

- C# is moving towards 'non-nullable by default' in C# 8.0:
    ```c#
    class Person
    {
        public string FirstName;   // Not null
        public string? MiddleName; // May be null
        public string LastName;    // Not null
    }
    ```

- TypeScript has first-class support for union types.
    ```ts
    function length(s: string|null): int|null { /*...*/ }
    ```

- Many other languages have first-class support for unions.

---

# (Mis-)using built-in types

Built-in types, like ints and strings, are often used to represent values that must fit some constraints. The presence of these constraints is not apparent from the type system.

For example:

```c#
public bool SendEmail(string from, string to, string body) { /* ... */ }
```

`string` can represent an arbitrary sized sequence of UTF-16 code points.

**There are definitely some strings which are not valid email addresses.** The example above is _stringly typed_.

---

# Single-case discriminated unions

A solution to the _stringly typed_ problem is to use _tiny types_ (aka single-case discriminated unions).

```f#
type EmailAddress = private EmailAddress of string
```

This is another instance of a union type introduced earlier, but with just a **single case**.

--

```f#
module EmailAddress =
    let tryParse (email : string) =
        // Yes, I know this is wrong
        if Regex.IsMatch(email, @"[a-z]+@[a-z]+.[a-z]+") then
            Some (EmailAddress email)
        else
            None
```

The `private` in the tiny type definition is optional. However, it gives us a **guarantee** that any `EmailAddress` we see in our code has been validated, as there is just a single public constructor (`EmailAddress.tryParse`).

---

# Single-case discriminated unions

```f#
type EmailAddress = private EmailAddress of string
```

```f#
let myEmail = EmailAddress.tryParse "saul.rennison@gresearch.co.uk"
match myEmail with
| None -> printfn "Could not parse"
| Some email ->
    let emailParts = email.Split '@'
    // ...
```

--

.error[
    `error FS0039: The field, constructor or member 'Split' is not defined.`
]

We can't implicitly access the underlying string.

The only methods/functions available for `EmailAddress` are ones we write.

---

# Single-case discriminated unions

```f#
type EmailAddress = private EmailAddress of string
```

Forces you to put your domain logic in one place:

```f#
module EmailAddress =
    let tryParse (email : string) = // ...
    let localPart (EmailAddress email) =
        email.Split('@').[0]
```

.important[
    - Value is validated at construction.
]

--

TomD did a great talk on domain modelling last Thursday.

---

# Single-case discriminated unions

```c#
public bool SendEmail(string from, string to, string body) { /* ... */ }
```

Can now be re-written as:

```f#
let sendEmail (from: EmailAddress) (to: EmailAddress) (body: string) : bool
```
